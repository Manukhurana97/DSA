OldCode.Recursion2: A function which call itself again and again
steps:
    1. Find base case
    2. find the relation b/w the problem and sub problem
    3. generalize the relation

    or create a decision tree


4 approach:
    1: input/output method (When we know the decision)
    2: base condition ->induction -> Hypothesis  (Make input Smaller) { Linked list, Tree}
    3: choice diagram

        2: base condition:  when to terminate eg : n=0, root==null
           hypothesis:  what is the logic eg: getHeight(root) -> height of tree
           induction : implementation of login
