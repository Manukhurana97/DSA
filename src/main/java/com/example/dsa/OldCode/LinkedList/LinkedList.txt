linear data structure

in array data is store in a continuous fashion
int LL data is stored in the random fashion
[data|next pointer] -> [data|next pointer] -> [data|next pointer] -> [data|next pointer] -> [data|next pointer]

inserting element in array is very difficult, need to do the right shift
