2. **Alerts Category**: Records category name and description for alerts.
3. **Alert Type**: Gathers alert type details, including product code and toggles for subscription settings.
4. **Subscription Criteria**: Defines subscription details with dynamic/static criteria options.

6. **Email Parameter**: Includes email-related fields and an ID/account number toggle.
7. **Reference Field**: Allows optional selection from created lists based on criteria.
8. **Communication Channels**: Offers email, onscreen, mobile, summary, and bell icon channels, each with distinct parameters.
